//the app object which serves as a function handler is
//supplied to an http server

//http takes the express app and does stuff with it
var server = require('http').Server(app);
//var http = require('http').Server(app);


//initialize a new instance of socket.io by
//passing in the http server
//the listen on the connection event
//for incoming sockets

//passing server to io
//socket.io-ifying the server

var io = require('socket.io')(server);

//this is what happens when you type the homepage
//serves up index.html from the working folder
//whenever you get a request, serve up the index.html

//whenever the socket.io object receives a new connection
//do something
//connection, disconnect, and a few others are reserved words
//ex / could use disconnect when people leave the game etc.

//message is also a reserved word


//move this into the other connection

io.on('connection', function(socket){

//not sure why there are 2 of these


//socket here is the client socket object (different from the io server object)

//as soon as connection happens
//client object is passes in as "socket"

//and its in the event loop permanently
//the connection only happens once per tab opening
//same for disconnect 

//like a conference call
//io hears everything that happens with the client "socket"
//and the client "socket" objects hear everything that is emitted from the server

//below is an event listener

//io is pulling the strings on all the client sockets
